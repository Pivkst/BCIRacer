# BCIRacer
Racing game designed to work with BCI systems

## Game requirements and wishes:
* Player has to control movement in space
* The game must enable dificulty level adjustments from very easy for getting familiar with basic game controls to advanced that may be challenging even with a standard computer interface. Levels may be defined by speed, number of different input commands, scene complexity etc.
* Adjustable to fit various BCI paradigms (P300, SSVEP, Motor Imagery) (ability to place animated GIFs on screen)
* The game must accept commands from external control modules that can be easily configured for operation with the main game module.
* Should enable sending game state data including game events to the control module, enabling advanced interface design based on modern signal analysis including AI.
* Running on Linux is an advantage
* The game should comply with positive cultural and social norms (e.g. prevent violence).

## BCI paradigms that should be supported
* P300: recognizes EEG response to in-game events
* SSVEP: (steady state evoked potentials) recognition of different flickering patterns of objects in user focus.
* Motor Imagery: recognition of imaginary (or real) movements of limbs.
